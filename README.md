# My Personal Website
Catto Petto is a simple 2-player JavaScript game made for the final project of Flariron School's Prework Course

## Features
- Control / movement using the left and right arrow keys (adopted from the moving element JavaScript lab)
- A start button that begins a countdown timer to 0
- Win checking to check which side the cat is on and play the appropriate win sequence
- A hard reset button that brings all elements back to their default state

# Known Bugs
- Start button can be pressed multiple times making the timer go much faster and go pass 0
- Left and Right movement is allowed even before the start button has been pressed
- The "draw" event triggers very incosistently, most of the time defaulting to a red win when cat is in middle
